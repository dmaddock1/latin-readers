<h2>NEWER METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF LATIN</h2>

<p class="fn" id="fn00"><sup>*</sup> Extracted from an article contributed to Mr. Sadler's <i>Special Reports</i>.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the watchwords of two opposed camps on 
the subject of language-teaching. The old-fashioned view that 
the "declining of nouns and verbs," to use Dr. Johnson's phrase, 
is a necessary preliminary to the reading of any text is nowadays 
met with the continental cry of "Fort mit der Grammatik!" 
But we are not really compelled to accept either of these harsh 
alternatives, as the more moderate adherents of the new German 
school are now fain to admit. Grammar has its proper place 
in any systematised method of teaching a language; but that 
place is not at the beginning but rather at the end of each of the 
steps into which a well-graduated course must be divided. 
Speaking of the course as a whole, we may say that the learning 
of grammar should proceed side by side with the reading of a 
text. The old view, which is far from extinct at the present day, 
though it is rarely carried out in all its rigour, was that the pupil 
must learn the rules of the game before he attempts to play it. 
The modern view is that just as in whist or hockey one learns 
the rules by playing the game, so in the study of a language one 
learns the grammar best by the reading of a simple text. But 
<span id="p012"/>
it is necessary at once to draw a distinction, which marks the 
difference between the earlier and the more developed form of 
the new method. The mistake made by the first zealots of the 
new school was that they plunged the pupil without preparation
into the reading of what were called "easy passages," &ndash; 
passages taken from any ordinary book, and easy perhaps as 
compared with other passages which might have been selected, 
but still bristling with a multitude of heterogeneous forms 
and constructions. This was an "inductive method" with a 
vengeance; but it soon became evident that to expect a young 
beginner to work his way through such a jungle to the light of 
clear grammatical consciousness was to expect too much;<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup> and 
even for the adult beginner the process is slow and laborious. 
For what is the object of grammar unless to make the facts of a 
language accessible and intelligible by presenting them in a 
simple arrangement? Here as elsewhere science ought surely to 
step in as an aid, not an obstacle, to understanding. What 
the advocates of the new school failed to see was that 
"nature" cannot dispense with "art"; in other words that the 
text which is to serve as the basis of an inductive study of the 
language must be specially constructed so as to exhibit those 
features on which the teacher desires to lay stress at a particular 
stage of learning.</p>

<p>What is the ordinary English practice at the present day? 
On this point others are more competent to speak than I; but 
I imagine I am not far wrong in saying that the first step in 
learning Latin is to spend a month or two in learning declensions 
and conjugations by rote &ndash; not, let us hope, complete with 
their irregularities and exceptions, but in outline. The pupil 
<span id="p013"/>
then proceeds to the reading and writing of easy sentences, 
perhaps in such a book as "Gradatim"; and after say a 
year or more he will be reading easy selections from a Latin 
author. All the while he recapitulates his grammar and extends
his grammatical horizon. This is, in any case, an 
immense improvement on the older plan of learning the whole 
of the old Eton Latin Grammar in its Latin dress without 
understanding a word of what is meant by its "as in praesenti" 
and other mysteries. If wisely administered, this method may 
also avoid the error of "Henry's First Latin Book," which 
taught an intolerable deal of Accidence and Syntax to a half-pennyworth
of text; though, on the other hand, Henry's First 
Latin Book was an attempt to accompany the learning of 
grammar with the reading of easy sentences from the very 
beginning, and in so far was better than the method we are considering.
For I must maintain, with all deference to the opinion 
of others whose experience is wider than my own, that we are as 
yet far from having drawn the full conclusions of the process of 
reasoning on which we have entered. There should be no preliminary
study of grammar apart from the reading of a text. The 
declensions and conjugations, learned by rote apart from their
applications, cannot be properly assimilated or understood, and often 
prove a source of error rather than enlightenment in subsequent 
study. They have to be learned over and over again &ndash; always in 
doses which are too large for digestion, and the pupil has meanwhile
been encouraged to form a bad habit of mind. Half knowledge
in this case too often leads to the unedifying spectacle of the 
Sixth Form boy or the University undergraduate who is still so 
shaky in his accidence that he cannot pass his "Smalls" without a 
special effort, though in some respects he may be a good scholar. 
But still more serious is the effect of the false conceptions which are 
inevitably implanted in the mind by this method of grammar without
understanding. The pupil learns <i>mensā</i>, "by or with a table," 
<span id="p014"/>
<i>agricolā</i>, "by or with a farmer" &ndash; both of them impossible Latin for 
the English in its natural sense; <i>mensae</i> meaning strictly "to a table;" 
is almost impossible in any elementary context. Yet the pupil 
necessarily supposes that in some context or other they must have 
those meanings; it is often years before he discovers that he has 
been the victim of a practical joke. Some boys never see the fun 
to the bitter end; in other words, they never learn the syntax of 
the Cases at all. And where are the counterbalancing advantages 
of this method? The pupil is introduced at an early stage to the 
reading of selections from Latin authors. But what if the interest 
and stimulus of reading consecutive passages could be secured 
without the sacrifice of clearness and grasp which is involved in 
the method of preliminary grammar? The advantages would 
seem in that case to be all on one side. Each new grammatical 
feature of the language would be presented as it is wanted, in an 
interesting context, and would be firmly grasped by the mind; at 
convenient points the knowledge acquired would be summed up 
in a table (the declension of a noun or the forms of a tense). 
The foundations of grammar would thus be securely laid; 
there would be no traps for the understanding, because each new 
feature would be presented in concrete form, that is in a context 
which explained it. For example, instead of <i>mensā</i>, "by or with a 
table," etc., we should have <i>in mensā</i>, "on a table," <i>cum agricoā</i>, 
"with a farmer," <i>ab agricolā</i>, "by a farmer"; <i>ad mensam</i>, "to a 
table" or sometimes "by (<i>i.e.</i> near) a table;" <i>agricolae dat</i>, but 
not <i>mensae dat</i>. After one declension had been caught in this 
way, the others would not need so elaborate a treatment. But still 
the old rule of "festina lente" would warn the teacher not to impose
too great a burden on the young or even the adult beginner; 
it is no light task to learn simultaneously forms and their 
meanings, vocabulary, and the fundamental facts of syntax. It 
must be admitted that the method which I am advocating is a slow 
one at first; but it is sure, and binds fast. The method of preliminary
<span id="p015"/>
grammar might be called the railroad method. The 
traveller by rail travels fast, but he sees little of the country 
through which he is whirled. The longest way round is often the 
shortest way home; and my experience has been that the time 
spent at the start without proceeding beyond the very elements of 
grammar is time well spent. A fair vocabulary is acquired &ndash; 
without effort &ndash; in the course of reading; for the learning of new 
wdrds, especially if they are chosen so as to present obvious 
similarities to English words, is a task eminently within the 
powers of the youthful mind; and all words met with in an 
interesting context arouse attention and impress themselves on the 
mind of their own accord. All the while the pupil is forming his 
feeling for the language and gradually becoming habituated 
to ordinary ways of saying ordinary things. He gradually loses 
that sense of strangeness which is the great barrier to anything like 
mastery.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> It is surprising how much can be said in Latin without 
using more than a single declension of nouns and adjectives and 
a single conjugation of verbs.<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup> The habit of reading very easy 
Latin, thus acquired at an early stage, will prove of the utmost 
value when the pupil approaches the study of a Latin author. 
Such a book as I have in mind should therefore do something to 
bridge over the formidable chasm which at present separates the 
reading of isolated sentences from the reading of an author.</p>

<p>All Latin authors as they stand, are far too difficult to 
serve as a basis of study for beginners: and they are also, I 
may add, not well adapted in respect of subject matter and 
<span id="p016"/>
sentiment to appeal to the mind of the very young. Caesar may 
no doubt be made interesting to a boy or girl of twelve by a skilful 
teacher with the aid of maps and pictures. But, after all, the Gallic 
War can never be what it was never meant to be, a child's book. 
The ideal "Reader," which should be the centre of instruction 
during the early stages of a young pupil's course, should be really 
interesting; simple and straightforward in regard to its subject 
matter, modern in setting, and as classical as may be in form &ndash; a 
book which the pupil may regard with benevolent feelings, not 
with mere "gloomy respect,"<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup> as worth knowing for its own sake. 
It should be well illustrated with pictures, diagrams, and maps, 
provided always that the illustrations are to the point, and such as 
are really felt to be needed to explain the text and make it live. 
"Modern in setting," for otherwise the book will not appeal to the 
young mind; yet there is much justification for the demand made 
by many adherents of the newer school that the subject matter 
of any school book dealing with a foreign language should be 
closely associated with the history and the manners and customs 
of the people who spoke or speak the language. Possibly the two 
demands are not irreconcilable; the subject matter may be 
historical and national, but the point of view from which it is 
regarded may be modern. For English pupils learning Latin the 
reconciliation ought to present little difficulty; but nearly every 
great nation of Europe has its points of contact with Rome, and 
therefore its opportunities of constructing Latin Readers which are 
national in more senses than one. On the modern side they may 
be patriotic in tone, and inspired by that love of nature which 
appeals so directly to the youthful mind; on the ancient side they 
may be historical and instructive in the narrower sense of the 
term. And the illustrations should also have this two-fold 
character; they should include subjects both ancient and modern, 
<span id="p017"/>
it being always remembered in regard to the former that their 
object is not to make the boy or girl an archaeologist, but simply 
to act as an aid to the imagination and enable it to realise what 
ancient civilisation was like. A good modern fancy sketch may 
often be more instructive from this point of view than a cut taken 
from a dictionary of antiquities.</p>

<p>The method which I advocate is, therefore, on its linguistic 
side, analogous in some respects to the so-called "natural method" 
or to the method by which an adult, left to his own resources, 
usually attempts to master a foreign tongue. He begins by 
attacking some easy book or newspaper, with the help of a 
dictionary, and he picks up the grammar as he goes along. The 
method is in both cases <i>heuretic</i>, in so far as the learner does 
not try to reconstruct the language out of the grammar, as 
a palaeontologist reconstructs an extinct animal from a study of a 
few bones. But in the one case the learner works on a text which 
presents all the variety and complexity of nature; in the other, on 
a text which has been simplified and systematised by art, so as to 
lead directly to a clear view of certain fundamental grammatical 
facts. Granted the premises, I conceive that there will be no great 
difficulty in accepting the conclusion; for there can hardly be a 
better method of teaching a language than that which combines the 
systematic order of the grammar with the interest and life of the 
story-book. The crux of the situation is to write such a school book; 
and though it may be long before an ideal book of the kind is produced,
the problem ought not to be impossible of solution, if once 
the necessity of a solution from the teaching point of view is realised. 
On the one hand the ideal book ought to have a sustained interest, 
and if possible to form a continuous narrative from beginning to 
end; otherwise much of the effect is lost; this adds materially to 
the difficulty of writing. On the other hand there are various 
considerations which lighten the task. The writer has before him 
an infinite variety of choice in regard to his subject matter; and 
<span id="p018"/>
though his grammatical order must be systematic, he is under no 
obligation to confine himself absolutely to the narrowest possible 
grammatical field at each step. For example adjectives<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fna05">5</a></sup> may be, 
as they should be on other grounds, treated side by side with the 
substantives which they resemble in form, and the easy forms of 
<i>possum</i> (<i>e.g., pot-es, pot-est, pot-eram</i>) side by side with the 
corresponding forms of <i>sum</i>. Here we have material for the 
building of sentences. We may even go further and admit a 
certain number of forms which anticipate future grammatical 
lessons, provided they are not too numerous or of such a character 
as to confuse the grammatical impression which it is the purpose 
in hand to produce. For example, forms like <i>inquam, inquit</i> 
might be introduced, if necessary, long before the learning of the 
defective verbs was reached; they would, of course, be accompanied
by their translations and treated as isolated words without 
any grammatical explanation. Tact in introducing only such forms 
as are not liable to lead to false inferences is necessary; and, of 
course, the fewer such anticipations there are the better. A 
certain latitude must also be conceded in regard to idiom and 
style. While it is of importance that the pupil should come across 
nothing which might react disadvantageously on his future composition,
it is mere pedantry to insist on any exalted standard of 
literary excellence. The writer who works under the limitation 
imposed by the conditions of the problem should not attempt any 
high style of diction; it is sufficient if his Latin is up to the 
standard of such isolated sentences as usually form the mental 
pabulum of the beginner, though it might well be somewhat 
higher.</p>

<p>I would here anticipate a possible objection. Would not such 
a book be too easy? Would it provide a sufficient amount of 
mental gymnastic to serve as a means of training the faculties of 
<span id="p019"/>
reason and judgment? That would depend altogether on the aim 
which the writer set before himself. There is plenty of room 
within the limits of the first declension and the first conjugation 
for the training of the mind in habits of accurate thought and 
expression; for instance, the sentences may be made as difficult in 
regard to order of words as you please. But I would urge that 
they can hardly be made too easy at the beginning. It is sometimes
forgotten that mental training is not synonymous with the 
inculcation of a mass of grammatical forms which only burden the 
memory, and that the habit of reading with care and fluency is itself
a mental discipline of the highest value. What the teacher of 
any language has to do is not to accustom his pupil to regard each 
sentence as a nut to crack or a pitfall to beware of; but rather to 
induce him by the art of "gentle persuasion" to look upon the 
foreign tongue as a friend to be approached on terms of easy 
familiarity. Difficulties will accumulate fast enough, and I submit 
with all deference that it is a mistake to convert the learning of 
any foreign language into an obstacle race, by deliberately throwing 
difficulties into the path of the learner. Latin, at any rate, is hard 
enough in itself. And a habit of thoughtlessness is surely the last 
thing that will be encouraged by a method such as that sketched 
above, by which learning is made a matter of observation from the 
first, and not of unintelligent memorizing.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the grammar to be taught in such 
a book should be limited to the necessary and normal. All that 
is in any way superfluous to the beginner should be rigorously 
excluded. But so soon as a general view of the whole field of 
regular accidence and the bare outlines of syntax has been attained 
by way of the Reader, the time has arrived for taking the pupil 
over the same ground again, as presented in the systematic form 
of the grammar. He is now in a position to understand what a 
grammar really is &ndash; not a collection of arbitrary rules, but a 
<i>catalogue raisonné</i> of the usages of a language based upon 
<span id="p020"/>
observation and simplified by science. Successive recapitulations 
should take in more and more of what is abnormal, until a fairly 
comprehensive view of the whole field is obtained. The suggestions 
of whatever new texts are read should, of course, be utilised in 
preparing the mind for irregularities and exceptions; but it is no 
longer perilous to study the grammar apart. Each course of 
grammar deepens the impression made by those which precede it, 
and at the same time extends the pupil's mental horizon, the 
successive courses being superimposed on one another like a 
number of concentric circles with ever widening diameters.</p>

<p>I have said nothing about the writing of Latin, because it is 
obvious at the present day that reading should be accompanied by 
writing from the first, and, what is even more important, that the 
sentences to be translated into Latin should be based on the 
subject matter and vocabulary of the Reader. Learning a 
language is largely an imitative process, and we must not expect 
our beginners to make bricks without straw, any more than we 
expect pupils at a more advanced age to compose in the style of 
Cicero or Livy without giving them plenty of models to 
work upon. It is more important to insist here on the importance
of training the organs of speech and hearing even in 
learning a "dead language" like Latin. For a dead language 
is still a language, and cannot be properly grasped unless it has 
some contact with living lip and living ear. Let the pupil 
then become accustomed from the first to reading Latin aloud, 
and to reading it with intelligence and expression. It is a 
habit which does not come of itself; but to teach it goes 
a long way towards making the language live again, and acts 
as a most valuable support to the memory. Let anyone try 
learning a little modern Greek, and he will appreciate the 
difference between remembering the accents by ear and remembering
them by the eye alone. So, too, in regard to forms 
and vocabulary. What we have to familiarise our pupils with is 
<span id="p021"/>
not merely the look of the word and the phrase and the sentence 
on paper, but still more, the shape of them to the ear.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the University a reform in school 
procedure, both on the literary and on the grammatical side, 
would confer great and lasting benefits.<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fna06">6</a></sup> There must be many 
University teachers who, like the present writer, feel dissatisfied 
with the scrappy and haphazard knowledge of the classics 
commonly presented by students reading for Pass degrees. But 
the foundations must be laid during the long school course, as the 
developed flower must be present in the germ. By not hurrying 
over the initial stages, and by a wise guidance of the later steps, the 
consummation of a worthy classical culture may be reached in the 
end.</p>

able to cover the ground at a fair rate of progress, is that it lends itself to 
acquiring the "art of <i>reading</i> Latin" (as distinct from the art of <i>construing</i> it), 
to use Prof. W. G. Hale's phrase &ndash; the art of rapid reading.</p>
