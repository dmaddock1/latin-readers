<p>The British soldiers used-to-fight from (<i>out-of</i>) chariots. Caesar 
had not only foot-soldiers but also horse-soldiers (<a href="prep09.html#psect029">§29</a>). But the 
mobility of the Roman soldiers was not great. Accordingly the 
enemy often used-to-throw-into-confusion the ranks of the Romans. 
In modern times<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup> horse-soldiers sometimes carry (<a href="prep02.html#psect006">§6</a>) the arms 
(<a href="prep10.html#psect030">§30</a>) of foot-soldiers. Thus they are able to leap<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> down-from 
(<a href="prep04.html#psect014">§14</a>) their horses and to fight on-foot. The Boers<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup> of South 
Africa have horse-soldiers of-this-kind.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> See <a href="drill10.html#dsect031">Ex. §31</a>, <a href="drill10.html#fn08">Note 8</a> (<a href="drill10.html#p130">p. 130</a>).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn02"><sup><a href="#fna02">2</a></sup> Say <i>give themselves</i>, as in <a href="prep07.html#psect025">§25</a> of the story.</p>

<p>The boundaries (<a href="prep12.html#psect034">§34</a>) of the Cassi were across (<a href="prep12.html#psect035">§35</a>) the river 
Thames. The British leader (<a href="prep09.html#psect029">§29</a>) used not to fight against the 
Romans in proper (<a href="prep14.html#psect037">§37</a>) battles. He used to dash suddenly out-of
the woods and attack the Roman legions. Then he used to 
recall (<a href="prep10.html#psect031">§31</a>) his horse-soldiers and his chariots. The British leader 
had many thousands (<a href="prep13.html#psect036">§36</a>) of charioteers. Accordingly he sometimes
used-to-carry-off the victory. There-were ten cohorts in a 
Roman legion, and about (<a href="prep13.html#psect036">§36</a>) five-hundred (<a href="prep13.html#psect036">§36</a>) men in a 
cohort. Accordingly there-were about five (<a href="prep07.html#psect026">§26</a>) thousand men 
(say <i>five thousands of men</i>) in a legion.</p>

<p>Caesar hastened to the banks of the river Thames.<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup> Where 
was the 'town' of Cassivellaunus? Caesar does not name the 
town. The town was not a city. It was not strengthened (<a href="prep10.html#psect030">§30</a>) 
with walls. It was not London. But it was not far from London. 
<span id="p135"/>
Perhaps<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fna05">5</a></sup> it was St. Albans,<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fna06">6</a></sup> as some learned men have affirmed. 
Caesar tells about the town of Cassivellaunus in the fifth book of 
the Gallic War.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn04"><sup><a href="#fna04">4</a></sup> In what Case must 'Thames' be? Think of the meaning.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn05"><sup><a href="#fna05">5</a></sup> For 'perhaps' see <i>Preparations</i> <a href="prep07.html#psect025">§25</a>.</p>

<p>Caesar's camp was<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fna07">7</a></sup> in Kent. There-is also a place in South 
Africa named<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fna08">8</a></sup> Caesar's Camp. The tribes of Kent fought bravely 
for (<i>on-behalf-of</i>) their native-land (<a href="prep01.html#psect004">§4</a>), but the Trinobantes were 
friends of the Romans and enemies of the Cassi. Accordingly the 
unhappy Britons fought in-vain. At-length (<a href="prep07.html#psect025">§25</a>) many states 
begged peace from (<i>a</i>) Caesar. The conditions of peace were 
hard (say <i>rough</i>, <a href="prep04.html#psect013">§13</a>). After the peace Caesar sold<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fna09">9</a></sup> a great 
multitude of British captives (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>). Thus many British men and 
women (<a href="prep06.html#psect020">§20</a>) and children were slaves (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) of the Romans in the 
first century before the birth of Christ.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn07"><sup><a href="#fna07">7</a></sup> Remember that the Verb must agree with its Subject (<i>castra</i>).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn08"><sup><a href="#fna08">8</a></sup> Remember that the Adjective must agree with its Noun. Which is the 
Noun to which the Adjective 'named' belongs?</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn09"><sup><a href="#fna09">9</a></sup> <i>Venum-do</i>, ' I sell,' is a compound of <i>do</i>, 'I give,' meaning literally 'I 
offer for sale,' and forms its Perfect like <i>do</i>.</p>
