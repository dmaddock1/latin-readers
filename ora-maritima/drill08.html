<p>(<i>A</i>). C. Julius Caesar was a famous (<i>clarus</i>, <a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>) general of the 
Romans in the first century B.C. Great was the glory (<a href="prep01.html#psect004">§4</a>) of C. 
Julius Caesar. The Gauls feared (<a href="prep01.html#psect002">§2</a>; say <i>used-to-fear</i>) Caesar. 
For within (<a href="prep07.html#psect022">§22</a>) three years he had defeated (<a href="prep07.html#psect024">§24</a>) the Helvetii<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup>
in South Gaul and the Veneti on the Gallic coast and the tribes 
of Belgic Gaul. There-were many Caesars before and after C. 
Julius Caesar. The Romans used-to-name<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> the Caesars 'Generals.' 
The forces of the Caesars were great. My uncle has told me 
many-things about the Caesars.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>). Why did Caesar wage-war against Britain? The cause (<a href="prep03.html#psect009">§9</a>) 
of the expedition against Britain is known (<a href="prep06.html#psect016">§16</a>). During the 
war with the Veneti some of the tribes<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup> of Britain had supplied 
auxiliaries to<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup> the Veneti. For the Veneti had been friends of the 
tribes of South Britain during many years. There had also been 
war between the tribes of South Britain. And the Trinobantes 
were friends of the Romans. Accordingly (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) Caesar prepared 
to supply aid to the Trinobantes against the Cassi.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> <i>Helvetii</i>, the plural of <i>Helvetius</i>, is a noun of the 2nd Declension. The 
Helvetii lived in <i>Helvetia</i> (Switzerland).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn02"><sup><a href="#fna02">2</a></sup> Use <i>nomino</i> 'I name,' from which comes the Adjective <i>nominatus, a, um</i>
'named' (<a href="prep03.html#psect011">§11</a>).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn03"><sup><a href="#fna03">3</a></sup> Translate 'tribe' by <i>natio</i> (instead of <i>populus</i>) in this and all following 
exercises.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn04"><sup><a href="#fna04">4</a></sup> The verb 'to supply' is a verb of 'giving.' How, then, is <i>to the Veneti</i> 
to be translated?</p>

<p>Caesar's first expedition was not great; but in the second 
expedition of the next year a great multitude of vessels and five 
legions sailed with Caesar to Britain. How-many<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fna05">5</a></sup> men were-there 
in a Roman legion? How-many men were-there in five Roman 
legions? The number was different (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) in different centuries. 
Among<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fna06">6</a></sup> Caesar's forces were also many Gallic auxiliaries. For 
the Belgae and other Gallic tribes had supplied forces to Caesar. 
Many Caesars were warlike. In the first century A.D. one (<a href="prep07.html#psect022">§22</a>) 
of the Caesars named Claudius was the second conqueror (<i>victor</i>) 
of Britain. I do not love the Caesars; but C. Julius Caesar was 
a great man and a great general.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn05"><sup><a href="#fna05">5</a></sup> 'How-many' is <i>quot</i> (indeclinable; see Latin Drill <a href="drill04.html#dsect013">§13</a>).</p>
