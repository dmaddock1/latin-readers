<h2>PREPARATIONS</h2>

<p>N<small>OTE TO THE</small> T<small>EACHER ON THE</small> P<small>RONUNCIATION OF</small> W<small>ORDS</small>. If the 
last syllable but one of a word of more than two syllables is <i>long</i>, it is also 
accented: if <i>short</i>, the accent is thrown back on to the last syllable but two. 
But words of only two syllables are always accented on the first of the two.</p>

<p>Syllables closed by two or more consonants are mostly long, as in <i>viLLa, 
luSCinia, iNTeRDum, paRTem, uMBRa, feneSTRa;</i> so too are syllables 
containing a double vowel, as in <i>nAUtAE</i>. But many syllables ending in a 
single consonant and containing a single vowel are also long, because the vowel 
is itself a <i>long vowel</i>: these vowels are marked in the text and vocabularies 
of this book. Thus <i>beata</i> and <i>antiqua</i> have the middle syllable long, and are 
therefore marked <i>beāta, antīqua</i>: and it is because the middle syllable in each 
of these words has a long vowel in it that it is accented (<i>beáta, antíqua</i>). 
Vowels which do not bear any mark may be regarded as short, as in <i>domina, 
amita, casa, quoque, mea, tua</i> (accented <i>dómina, ámita, cása, quóque, méa, 
túa</i>).</p>

<p>In the Drill Exercises and Appendices (<a href="drill01.html">pp. 101-144</a>) the quantities of the 
long vowels are not marked, except for some special reason (e.g. in order to 
distinguish the ablative singular of the 1st declension from the nominative 
singular). These pages will provide an opportunity of testing how far the ear 
of the pupil has been trained by the study of the text.</p>
