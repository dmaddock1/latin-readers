end in two consonants</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>A.</i>) Cassivellaunus was king of a small part of South Britain 
What<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup> was the name of the race? In ancient times<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> there-were 
many races and many kings in Britain. Many<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup> of the races were 
barbarous. But the races of the Southern (use <i>meridianus, a, um</i>) 
parts were not barbarous. Before the times of Caesar Cassivellaunus
had fought against the-other (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) races of South 
Britain. The name of the king of the Trinobantes was 
Imanuentius.</p>

<p>(<i>B.</i>) The boundaries of many British races are not known (<a href="prep06.html#psect016">§16</a>) 
to us. The names of the British kings are mostly (<a href="prep04.html#psect013">§13</a>) not 
mentioned (<a href="prep04.html#psect014">§14</a>) in the book of Caesar. Britain was not a part 
of the Roman empire<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup> after the victory of Caesar. After the 
time of Claudius, the fourth (<a href="prep09.html#psect029">§29</a>) Caesar,<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fna05">5</a></sup> Britain was under the 
command<sup><a href="#fn04">4</a></sup> of the Caesars. The name of the family (use <i>gens</i>) of 
C. Julius Caesar was the Julian family. The Romans used-to-name
the Caesars "Princes" and "Generals."</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> See <a href="drill10.html#dsect30">Ex. §30</a>, <a href="drill10.html#fn03">note 3</a> (<a href="drill09.html#p129">p. 129</a>).</p>

<p id="dsect35"><a href="story12.html#para035">§35.</a> (<i>Same Nouns continued</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>A.</i>) Some<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fna06">6</a></sup> of the Southern or maritime races of Britain were 
Belgians (<a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>). But the Belgae were of German origin, as Caesar 
tells us in the 'Gallic War.' The chapter is the fourth of the second 
book. Therefore there-were people<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fna07">7</a></sup> of German origin in Britain 
in the first and second century B.C. The inhabitants of modern 
Britain (say <i>of Britain of-the-present-day</i>) are mostly of German 
origin. But they migrated across the German ocean into Britain 
in the fourth and the fifth century after the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>(<i>B.</i>) Many modern cities are named from (use <i>ex</i>) the Belgian 
(<a href="prep03.html#psect011">§11</a>) races of Kent. The names of the cities are Belgian. But 
the Belgians of Britain used not to build cities, if the testimony 
(<a href="prep06.html#psect017">§17</a>) of Caesar is true. Winchester (<a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>) is the name of an ancient 
city of South Britain. The inhabitants of cities are not barbarous. 
Caesar tells us about British 'towns.' The British 'towns' were 
different from (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) cities.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn06"><sup><a href="#fna06">6</a></sup> What Gender? 'Some of the races' means 'some <i>races</i> of the races.' 
For 'of' use <i>ex</i>.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn07"><sup><a href="#fna07">7</a></sup> Say <i>men</i>, and use <i>homo</i> (<i>Prep.</i> <a href="prep10.html#psect030">§30</a>). <i>Homo</i> means 'human being' and 
includes women; <i>vir</i> does not include women. The Plural of <i>homo</i> is the only 
word that can be used for 'people' in the sense of 'persons'; for <i>populus</i>
means '<i>a</i> people' in the sense of 'a nation' or 'a tribe,' and the Plural 
<i>populi</i> means 'nations' or 'tribes.'</p>
