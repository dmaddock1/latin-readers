<h3>II.&mdash;HOW TO TRANSLATE ENGLISH PREPOSITIONS 
INTO LATIN</h3>

<p>Where English has a Preposition Latin generally has one also. 
Most of these Latin Prepositions take the Accusative Case, but 
some of them (especially <i>ab</i> or <i>a, cum, de, ex, in</i> when it means 
'in' or 'on,' <i>pro, sub</i> when it means 'under,' and <i></i>sine) take the 
Ablative: it should be noted that no Latin Prepositions take the 
Dative or the Genitive. But it has been seen that 'of' is generally 
expressed by the Genitive alone, and 'to' very often by the Dative 
alone; also that 'from,' 'at,' 'in,' 'with,' 'by,' and 'by means of 
are sometimes expressed by the Ablative alone. The following 
rules, based upon examples which have occurred in this book, 
will give some guidance as to when the above Prepositions are to 
be translated by Prepositions in Latin and when by a Case without 
any Preposition; but the rules are only an outline, to be filled up by 
future reading, and they deal only with the most important usages.</p>

<p><b><i>OF</i></b> is generally translated by the Genitive, as in 'the door of 
the country-house,' <i>ianua villae</i> (<a href="story01.html#para001">§1</a>), 'the courage of sailors,' 
<i>audacia nautarum</i> (<a href="story01.html#para002">§2</a>), 'traces of the Romans,' <i>vestigia Romanorum</i>
(<a href="story03.html#para009">§9</a>), 'a task of great labor,' <i>opus magni laboris</i> (= 'very 
laborious,' <a href="story10.html#para031">§31</a>), 'an abundance of plants,' <i>copia plantarum</i> (<a href="story01.html#para003">§3</a>), 'a 
great number of coins,' <i>magnus numerus nummorum</i> (<a href="story03.html#para009">§9</a>).<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="outdent">But (i.) in such phrases as 'some of,' 'many of,' the 'of' may be 
translated by <i>ex</i> with the Ablative; thus 'some of the 
vessels' may be translated <i>nonnulla ex navigiis</i> (<a href="story03.html#para011">§11</a>), 
'many of the tribes,' <i>multi ex populis</i> (<a href="story06.html#para018">§18</a>).</p>

<p class="outdent2 noindent">(ii.) when the phrase 'of &mdash;' describes a quality of the 
person or thing spoken of, it is sometimes translated by the 
Ablative without a Preposition; thus 'men of robust body' 
is <i>homines robusto corpore</i> (<a href="story10.html#para030">§30</a>): cf. <a href="story15.html#para043">§43</a>, note on <a href="prep15.html#p099">p. 99</a>.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> It may be noted that the 'of' in many of these examples does not denote 
<i>possession</i>.</p>

<span id="p142"/>
<p><b><i>TO</i></b> is generally translated by <i>ad</i> with the Accusative (or sometimes
by <i>in</i> with the Accusative, <a href="prep03.html#psect011">§11</a>) when it comes after a verb 
of 'going' or any verb that denotes motion, such as 'bring' or 
'carry' or 'send:' thus 'I walk to the wood' is <i>ad silvam ambulo</i>
(<a href="story01.html#para005">§5</a>). But it is sometimes translated by the Accusative without a 
Preposition, sometimes by the Dative; viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the Accusative without a Preposition when it comes before 
the name of a Town: thus 'he brought his vessels to Dover' is 
<i>navigia Dubras applicavit</i> (<a href="story07.html#para024">§24</a>), 'I walked to London' is 
<i>Londinium ambulavi</i>.</p>

<p>By the Dative in the following cases:</p>

<p class="noindent">(i) when it comes after a verb of 'giving'; thus 'it gives 
delight to Lydia,' is <i>Lydiae laetitiam dat</i> (<a href="story01.html#para005">§5</a>), 'they had 
supplied auxiliaries to the Gauls' is <i>Gallis auxilia subministraverant</i>
(<a href="story08.html#para027">§27</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">(ii) when it comes after the verb 'to be' in the phrase 'there 
is to someone' = 'someone has'; thus 'my uncle has coins' 
is <i>patruo meo nummi sunt</i> (<a href="story03.html#para009">§9</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">(iii) when it comes after Adjectives which can take 'to' in 
English, like 'dear,' 'pleasant,' 'useful'; thus 'he is dear 
to us' is <i>nobis carus est</i> (<a href="story05.html#para015">§15</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>FROM</i></b> is generally translated by <i>ab</i> or <i>ex</i> with the Ablative; 
but by the Ablative alone&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">(i) when it comes after certain Verbs and Adjectives with the 
sense of 'free'; thus 'he is free from military service' is 
<i>militia vacat</i> (<a href="story02.html#para006">§6</a>), 'free from lessons' is <i>liber scholis</i> (<a href="story04.html#para012">§12</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">(ii) when it comes before the name of a Town and after a 
Verb of 'going' or any Verb that denotes motion; thus 
'they will arrive from Dover' is <i>Dubris adventabunt</i>
(<a href="story07.html#para022">§22</a>).</p>

<span id="p143"/>
<p><b><i>IN</i></b> or <b><i>AT</i></b><sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> is generally translated by <i>in</i> with the Ablative; but 
by the Ablative alone&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">(i) when it comes before a Noun denoting time, such as 'day,' 
'month,' 'year,' 'century,' 'hour'; thus 'in the second 
century' is <i>secundo saeculo</i> (<a href="story03.html#para010">§10</a>), 'in the next year' is 
<i>proximo anno</i> (<a href="story08.html#para028">§28</a>), 'at what o'clock?' is <i>quota hora?</i> (<a href="story07.html#para021">§21</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">(ii) when it comes before a Noun denoting price or value: 
thus 'at a great price' is <i>magno pretio</i> (<a href="story03.html#para009">§9</a>).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn02"><sup><a href="#fna02">2</a></sup> When 'at' comes before the name of a Town, it is translated by the 
Locative without a Preposition; but no example of this Case occurs in this 
book. The Locative, however, is the same in form as the Ablative, except in 
the 1st and 2nd Declension, Singular Number.</p>

<p><b><i>WITH</i></b> is translated by <i>cum</i> with the Ablative when it means 
'together with' or 'in company with' (as in 'I walk with my 
aunt,' <i>cum amita mea ambulo</i>, <a href="story01.html#para003">§3</a>, or 'fighting with the Romans,' 
<i>cum Romanis pugnantes</i>, <a href="story15.html#para043">§43</a>)<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup>; but by the Ablative alone in 
other senses; viz:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">(i) when 'with' means 'by means of;' thus 'they used to 
fight with spears and arrows' is <i>hastis et sagittis 
pugnabant</i> (<a href="story06.html#para018">§18</a>): here 'spears and arrows' are the 
<i>instruments</i> with which they fought. Similarly when 
'with' comes after Adjectives meaning 'filled'; thus 
'filled with victims' is <i>plenus victimis</i> (<a href="story06.html#para020">§20</a>)<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup>, 'crowded 
with children' is <i>creber pueris et puellis</i> (<a href="story05.html#para015">§15</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">(ii) when the phrase 'with &mdash;' answers the question 
'how?'; thus 'they used to fight with great courage' is 
<i>magna audacia pugnabant</i>. Here 'with great courage' 
describes the <i>manner</i> in which they fought.</p>

<p class="noindent">(iii) when the phrase 'with &mdash;' answers the question 
'why?' thus 'the climate was hideous with rains ' is 
<i>caelum pluviis foedum erat</i> (<a href="story06.html#para017">§17</a>). Here 'with rains' 
means 'because of rains.'</p>

<p class="noindent">(iv) when the phrase 'with &mdash;' describes a <i>quality</i> of the
person or thing spoken of; thus 'a man with a robust 
body' is <i>homo robusto corpore</i> (<a href="story10.html#para030">§30</a>), 'a boy with blue 
eyes' is <i>puer oculis caeruleis</i>.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn03"><sup><a href="#fna03">3</a></sup> Sometimes <i>una</i> 'together' is added, as in 'together with a multitude of 
Gallic auxiliaries, <i>una cum multitudine auxiliorum Gallicorum</i> (<a href="story08.html#para028">§28</a>).</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn04"><sup><a href="#fna04">4</a></sup> But just as in English we may say not only 'filled <i>with</i>' but also 'full <i>of</i>' 
so in Latin <i>plenus</i> may take the Genitive; thus 'full of joys' is <i>plenus 
gaudiorum</i> (<a href="story04.html#para013">§13</a>).</p>

<span id="p144"/>
<p><b><i>BY MEANS OF</i></b> is sometimes translated by <i>per</i> ('through') with 
the Accusative, but generally by the Ablative without a Preposition: 
thus 'they used to fasten their ships by means of iron chains' is 
<i>naves catenis ferreis deligabant</i> (<a href="story11.html#para033">§33</a>), 'he hastened to the Thames 
by means of uninterrupted marches' is <i>continuis itineribus ad 
Tamesam properavit</i> (<a href="story14.html#para038">§38</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>BY</i></b> is sometimes translated by <i>ab</i> or <i>a</i> with the Ablative, but 
generally by the Ablative without a Preposition: thus 'by reason 
(= for the sake) of commerce' is <i>mercaturae causa</i> (<a href="story06.html#para019">§19</a>), cf. <i>animi 
causa</i> (<a href="story06.html#para020">§20</a>); 'by land and by sea' is <i>terra marique</i> (<a href="story15.html#para043">§43</a>).</p>
