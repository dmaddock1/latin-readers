Where will the place be? The place will be on the coast of Kent,

Alexander, will walk with me and with my uncle to the place.</p>

<p>The sky was clear when we walked to the place where Gaius 
Julius fought with the Britons. In the year 55 B.C.<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fna08">8</a></sup> he built 
vessels in Gaul and sailed from the Gallic coast to the coast of 
Kent. He brought his vessels to land between Dover and Richborough,

as learned men have generally (<i>mostly</i>, <a href="prep04.html#psect013">§13</a>) affirmed. The 
Britons were prepared (<a href="prep07.html#psect021">§21</a>), and they hastened to the place. My

<p>When Gaius Julius anchored<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fna09">9</a></sup> his vessels near the British 
coast, the Britons had already gathered themselves together on the 
cliffs. "We Britons will never be slaves (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>)" they say (<a href="prep07.html#psect021">§21</a>). 
They had hastened along the sea-shore and had prepared themselves
for battle (<a href="prep07.html#psect024">§24</a>). Roman forces had never before sailed to 
our island. But Gallic vessels had often sailed to Britain for the 
sake of commerce. Gaius Julius had never before been in Britain. 
But he had waged-war (<a href="prep07.html#psect024">§24</a>) against the inhabitants of the neighbouring
coast. The Gauls (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) had told Gaius Julius<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fna10">10</a></sup> many-things
about Britain.</p>
