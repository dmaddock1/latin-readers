which the Adjective is called an <i>Attribute</i> of the Noun, but also 
to examples like the following, in which the Adjective is used with 
the Verb 'to be' and is called a <i>Predicate Adjective</i>:</p>

<p>A learned teacher is sometimes not dear to boys. Our teacher 
is learned. Boys are not learned. My aunt is not learned. But 
we boys love our teacher. And my aunt likes to listen when a 
learned man tells about the ancient Britons. There-were<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> great 
forests in ancient Britain. But there-were not many beeches in 
the British forests. So Gaius Julius affirms. There-were many 
wolves and bears in the great forests of ancient Britain.</p>

<p>Were the Roman sailors lazy? Gaius Julius does not blame 
(<a href="prep04.html#psect014">§14</a>) the Roman sailors. He praises<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fna03">3</a></sup> the courage of his sailors. 
Roman farmers were active, as a Roman poet affirms. There were 
many Roman sailors (say <i>many sailors Roman</i>) on the vessels of 
Gaius<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fna04">4</a></sup> Julius. Roman vessels were-able to sail to Britain and 
round the British coast. The rains of Britain were hideous then,<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fna05">5</a></sup>
as they are now.<sup><a href="#fn05">5</a></sup> The small pearls of the British ocean were 
mostly (<a href="prep04.html#psect013">§13</a>) dark or blue.</p>

<p>The large vessels of British sailors are mostly (<a href="prep04.html#psect013">§13</a>) black; but 
the little boats are sometimfes white, sometimes blue, sometimes 
yellow. Last year, while (<a href="prep06.html#psect016">§16</a>) I was in Kent, I used-to-see many 
British sailors. They were all sun-burnt. Some<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fna06">6</a></sup> of the sailors 
used-to-tattoo (say colour) their limbs. The clothes of British 
and French sailors are blue. British sailors mostly have sturdy 
limbs and a great stature. Our sailors sail round the coasts of all 
lands, as the Roman sailors used-to-sail round the coasts of the 
Mediterranean.<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fna07">7</a></sup> A British sailor does not fear storms.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn06"><sup><a href="#fna06">6</a></sup> The word for 'some' must stand in the Nominative Case and be Masculine 
Plural, because 'some of the sailors' means 'some <i>sailors</i> of the sailors'; see 
the example in <a href="story03.html#para011">§11</a> of the story.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn07"><sup><a href="#fna07">7</a></sup> Say 'the Mediterranean ocean.' 'Mediterranean' is an Adjective, meaning
'Mid-land,' and is in Latin <i>Mediterraneus</i> (<i>a, um</i>).</p>

<p>Were all the inhabitants of ancient Britain Celts? I think not<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fna08">8</a></sup> 
Some of the ancient inhabitants of our island were not barbarous. 
The inhabitants of Kent were mostly farmers, as they are now.<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fna09">9</a></sup>
Many of the inhabitants of Kent were Belgians (<a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>). Were not 
the Belgians a German tribe (<a href="prep06.html#psect018">§18</a>)? Does not Gaius Julius so 
affirm in his book about the Gallic war? The German tribes were 
moderately civilized, but the ancient Celts of Britain were not 
civilized.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn08"><sup><a href="#fna08">8</a></sup> A very common way of saying 'I think not,' 'I hope not,' and so forth in

<p>(<i>A.</i>) In the second century before the birth of Christ<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fna11">11</a></sup> Britain 
was free. The boys and girls (<a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>) of the uncivilized Britons 
were free from lessons. The savage (<a href="prep06.html#psect018">§18</a>) Britons together with 
their sons used-to-kill stags and wild-boars in the woods with 
spears and arrows. They used-to-catch (<a href="prep02.html#psect007">§7</a>) wild-beasts with 
hunting dogs (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>) for the sake of food.</p>

<p>(<i>B.</i>) The civilized Britons used-to-adorn<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fna12">12</a></sup> their limbs with 
golden chains and with precious-stones (<a href="prep06.html#psect019">§19</a>). By means of the 
vessels of the Veneti they used-to-export corn to Gaul. The 
Druids were the teachers of the children of the civilized Britons. 
The Romans used not to fight with chariots. They used-to-fight 
with barbarous tribes for the sake of victory and gain (<a href="prep03.html#psect009">§9</a>). They 
used often to kill their captives; but sometimes they used to sell 
the captives at a great price (<a href="prep03.html#psect009">§9</a>).</p>

<p><sup><a href="#fna10">10</a></sup> N<small>OTE ON THE</small> A<small>BLATIVE WITHOUT A</small> P<small>REPOSITION</small>. The following 
English Prepositions are to be translated by the Ablative without a Preposition 
in certain cases.</p>

<p>'From,' when it comes after 'free' (<i>liber</i>, <a href="prep04.html#psect012">§12</a>) and 'I am free' (<i>vaco</i>, <a href="prep02.html#psect006">§6</a>).</p>

<p>'In' or 'At,' when it comes befere a Noun denoting time, as 'in the second 
century,' <i>secundo saeculo</i> (<a href="prep03.html#psect010">§10</a>), 'at what o'clock?' <i>quotā horā?</i> (<a href="prep07.html#psect021">§21</a>). Also 
before a Noun denoting price or value, as 'at a great price,' <i>magno pretio</i> (<a href="prep03.html#psect009">§9</a>).</p>

<p>'With,' when it means 'by means of,' or forms a phrase answering the 
question 'how?'; as 'they used to fight with spears and arrows,' <i>hastis et 
sagittis pugnabant</i> (<a href="prep06.html#psect018">§18</a>), 'they used to fight with great courage,' <i>magnā 
audaciā pugnabant;</i> 'hideous with rains,' <i>pluviis foedum</i> (<a href="prep06.html#psect017">§17</a>); 'filled with 
victims,' <i>victimis plena</i> (<a href="prep06.html#psect020">§20</a>); 'crowded with children,' <i>liberis creber</i> (<a href="prep05.html#psect015">§15</a>).</p>

<p>'By means of' is generally to be translated by the Ablative alone.</p>
