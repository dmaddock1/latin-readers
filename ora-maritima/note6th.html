<h2><i>NOTE TO THE SIXTH EDITION</i></h2>

<p><i>In the present issue of this book I have, in deference to the 
wishes of many teachers, returned to the principle of marking long 
vowels in the text, which I adopted in my Parallel Grammar 
Series. As to the method of carrying out the principle I have 
stated my views in the Preface</i> (<a href="preface.html#pvii">p. vii</a>).</p>

<p><i>I have also corrected one or two oversights to which I had 
called attention in previous issues (p. 119, l. 1, 'sometimes not' 
for 'not always'; p. 123, ll. 4 and 8 of §23, 'tenth for seventh'). 
On p. 48, l. 5, I have substituted 'multa ex navigiis' for 'magnus 
numerus navigiorum,' in order to avoid raising a difficulty of construction.
And there are a few other minor improvements of this 
kind (p. 130, §31 B; p. 144 bottom). But in all essentials the 
book is unchanged.</i></p>

<p><i>I herewith express my cordial thanks to those teachers who have 
pointed out to me misprints or omissions in the vocabularies&mdash;in 
particular to Professor Postgate, Mr. F. E. A. Trayes, Mr. R. S. 
Haydon, Miss A. F. E. Sanders. These oversights&mdash;not very 
many in number&mdash;have all been corrected in the present issue.</i></p>

<p><i>May I call the attention of teachers to the mistake, into which 
pupils easily fall, of pronouncing the word 'Maritima' like the 
French 'maritime' with the accent on the syllable ti-, instead of 
Marítima?</i></p>
