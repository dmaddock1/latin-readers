<h2>APPENDICES.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup></h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;O<small>N</small> A<small>DJECTIVES IN</small> -NDUS, A, UM <small>AND</small> N<small>OUNS 
IN</small> -NDUM.</h3>

<p>The Adjectives in <i>-ndus, a, um</i> differ from other Adjectives 
only in the following respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) They are all formed from the stems of Verbs. In English, 
too, we have many Adjectives formed from Verbs, and some of 
them are similar in meaning to the Latin Adjectives in <i>-ndus, 
a, um</i>; for instance 'laud-able' (from 'I laud,' Lat. <i>laudo</i>), 
'lov-able' (in the sense 'worthy to be loved,') 'eat-able' (in the 
sense 'fit to be eaten.')</p>

<p>(2) They cannot always be translated by Adjectives in English, 
because English generally has no Adjective with exactly the same 
meaning; so they have often to be translated by a phrase like 
'to-be-loved,' 'to-be-read,' 'to-be-eaten.' Sometimes it is convenient
to translate them in other ways.</p>

<p>The following sentences, taken from the story, should be carefully
examined.</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Audacia aquiliferi erat laudanda</i>, 'the courage of the eagle-bearer 
<span id="p139"/>
was laud-able or praise-worthy' (<a href="story07.html#para025">§25</a>). Here the Adjective 
<i>laudanda</i> (feminine of <i>laudandus</i>, to agree with <i>audacia</i>) is 
formed from the Verb <i>laudo</i>, 'I praise,' and it has the same 
meaning as the English Adjective formed with '-able ' or 
'-worthy;' but we may also translate it by 'worthy-to-be 
praised,' or simply 'to-be-praised.' This Adjective, like 
other Adjectives, may be used without the Verb 'to be,' 
and in any Case; thus we get</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>N<small>OM.</small></th>
<td><i>audacia laudanda</i>, 'laudable courage'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A<small>CC.</small></th>
<td><i>audaciam laudandam</i>, 'laudable courage'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>G<small>EN.</small></th>
<td><i>audaciae laudandae</i>, 'of laudable courage,' etc</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="outdent2">Hence such a phrase may be made to depend on a 
Preposition, as shown in the next sentence.</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Locus erat idoneus ad navigia applicanda</i>, 'there was a place suitable 
for vessels to-be-brought-to-land' (<a href="story07.html#para024">§24</a>). Here the phrase 
<i>navigia applicanda</i>, 'vessels to-be-brought-to-land' depends 
on <i>ad</i> in the sense of 'for.' Compare in English such 
common sentences as 'Ring the bell for the dinner to be 
got ready.' (Latin <i>ad cenam parandam</i>.)</p>

<p>The Nouns in <i>-ndum</i> differ from other Nouns only in the 
following respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) They are all formed from the stems of Verbs, just as in 
English we may form a Noun out of any Verb by adding '-ing.' 
Thus where in English we speak of 'row-ing,' 'walk-ing,' 
'visit-ing,' etc., the Romans used the Nouns <i>remigandum, ambulandum,
visitandum</i>, etc.</p>

<p>(2) They are like Verbs in so far as they take the same constructions
as the Verbs from which they are formed. So, too, do 
the English Nouns formed from Verbs; thus we speak of 'rowing 
quickly,' 'walking slowly' (with Adverbs, though sometimes also 
with Adjectives), and 'visiting a friend,' 'exploring a country' 
(with Objects depending on the Nouns in '-ing ').</p>

<span id="p140"/>
<p class="outdent"><i>Labor remigandi magnus erat</i>, 'the labour of rowing was great' 
(<a href="story09.html#para029">§29</a>). Here <i>remigandi</i> is the Genitive Case of the Noun 
<i>remigandum</i> formed from <i>remigo</i>, 'I row.'</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Paratine estis ad ambulandum?</i> 'are you ready for walking?' (<a href="story07.html#para023">§23</a>). 
Here <i>ambulandum</i> is the Accusative Case of the Noun 
formed from <i>ambulo</i>, 'I walk,' and depends on <i>ad</i> meaning 
'for.'</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Cupidus erat visitandi et explorandi insulam nostram</i>, 'he was 
desirous of visiting and exploring our island' (<a href="story08.html#para028">§28</a>). Here 
the Genitives of the Nouns <i>visitandum</i> and <i>explorandum</i>
take an Object in the Accusative.</p>

<p>The following sentences, taken from the story, contain further 
examples of the above constructions (Adjectives and Nouns).</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Virtus militum erat magnopere laudanda</i> (<a href="story09.html#para029">§29</a>). Here the 
Adjective is qualified by an Adverb (as other Adjectives 
may be).</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Navigia novis armis ornanda erant</i> (<a href="story10.html#para031">§31</a>).</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Locus idoneus est ad copias explicandas</i> (<a href="story07.html#para025">§25</a>).</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Naves onerariae aptae erant ad onera transportanda</i> (<a href="story11.html#para032">§32</a>).<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Romani Britannos scientia pugnandi superabant</i> (<a href="story10.html#para030">§30</a>).</p>

<p>[No example occurs in the story of the Noun in <i>-ndum</i> with <i>est</i> 
denoting 'must' or 'ought.' This is a special use and sense, 
which is best deferred for subsequent study.]</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> These Appendices are not intended to be used by the pupil except as a 
summary and fuller explanation of some of the constructions which have been 
met with in the text. But they are written with a view to the needs of 
beginners, and are thrown into a form which the writer has found to be 
capable of appealing to the minds even of young pupils, if brought before them 
gradually and on seasonable occasions.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn02"><sup><a href="#fna02">2</a></sup> Such sentences may also be translated by an entirely different form of 
speech in English ('for <i>deploying</i> forces.') Here 'deploying' is a <i>Noun</i> 
formed from the Verb 'deploy.' But this translation leads to confusion with the 
use of the Latin Noun in <i>-ndum</i>, and should therefore be avoided so far as 
possible by beginners.</p>
