<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>My apology for adding another to the formidable array of 
elementary Latin manuals is that there is no book in existence 
which satisfies the requirements which I have in mind as of most 
importance for the fruitful study of the language by beginners. 
What I desiderate is:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A continuous narrative from beginning to end, capable of 
appealing in respect of its vocabulary and subject matter to the 
minds and interests of young pupils, and free from all those 
syntactical and stylistic difficulties which make even the easiest of 
Latin authors something of a problem.</p>

<p>2. A work which shall hold the true balance between too much 
and too little in the matter of systematic grammar. In my 
opinion, existing manuals are disfigured by a disproportionate 
amount of <i>lifeless Accidence</i>. The outcome of the traditional system 
is that the pupil learns a multitude of Latin <i>forms</i> (Cases, Tenses, 
Moods), but very little Latin. That is to say, he acquires a 
bowing acquaintance with all the forms of Nouns and Verbs&mdash;such
as Ablatives in <i>a, e, i, o, u,</i> 3rd Persons in <i>at, et, it,</i> and so 
forth&mdash;before he gets a real hold of the meaning or use of any of 
these forms. But, as Goethe said in a different connexion, "What 
one cannot use is a heavy burden"; and my experience leads me 
to think that a multitude of forms acts as an encumbrance to the 
pupil at an early stage by distracting his attention from the more 
vital matters of vocabulary, sentence construction, and order of 
words. The real meaning of the Ablative, for instance, can be 
just as well learned from the 1st Declension as from all the 
declensions taken together. And further, to run over all the 
declensions without proper understanding of their meanings and 
<span id="pvi"/>
uses with and without Prepositions is a real danger, as begetting 
all sorts of misconception and error&mdash;so much so that the muddled 
pupil too often never learns the syntax of the Cases at all. No 
doubt all the Declensions and Conjugations must be learned before
a Latin author is attacked. But when a few of them have 
been brought within the pupil's ken, he finds little difficulty in 
mastering the others in a rapid and more mechanical fashion. In 
the present book I have dealt directly with only three declensions 
of Nouns and Adjectives and the Indicative Active of <i>sum</i> and of 
the 1st Conjugation (incidentally introducing some of the forms of 
Pronouns, and those forms of the Passive which are made up with 
the Verb-adjectives, as in English); but in connexion with this 
amount of Accidence I have treated very carefully the most 
prominent uses of the Cases with and without Prepositions, and 
the question of the order of words, which I have reduced to a few 
simple rules. It is my hope that teachers who trust themselves to 
my guidance in this book will agree with me in thinking that the 
time spent on such fundamental matters as these is not thrown 
away. The pupil who has mastered this book ought to be able to 
read and write the easiest kind of Latin with some degree of 
fluency and without serious mistakes: in a word, Latin ought to 
have become in some degree a living language to him.</p>

<p>Above all it is my hope that my little story may be read with 
pleasure by those for whom it is meant. The picture which it 
gives of the early Britons is intended to be historically correct, so 
far as it goes; and the talk about "anchors" and "boats" and 
"holidays" will perhaps be acceptable as a substitute for "iustitia," 
"modestia," "temperantia," and the other abstract ideas which 
hover like ghosts around the gate of Latin.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup> I have kept my 
Vocabulary strictly classical, in spite of the temptation to introduce 
<span id="pvii"/>
topics of purely modern interest, such as bicycles: in the later 
sections of the book it is Caesarian. The number of words in the 
vocabulary is relatively large; but words are necessary if anything 
worth saying is to be said, and a large proportion of my words have 
a close resemblance to the English words derived from them. Apart 
from this, the acquisition of a working vocabulary is an essential 
part of any real mastery of a language, and it is a task eminently 
within the powers of the youthful mind.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> "The pupil ordinarily approaches Latin and Greek through a <i>cloud of
abstractions"</i>&mdash;A. Sidgwick.</p>

<p>In regard to the quasi-inductive study of grammar I have 
expressed myself in an article contributed to Mr. Sadler's <i>Special 
Reports</i>, extracts from which are given below. But I wish it to be 
understood that there is nothing in this book to prevent its being 
used by teachers who prefer the traditional method of teaching the 
Grammar before the sections of the story and the Exercises in 
which it is embodied. All the Grammar required is given in the 
"<a href="prep00.html">Preparations</a>" (e.g. pp. <a href="prep01.html#p065">65</a>, <a href="prep02.html#p066">66</a>, <a href="prep02.html#p067">67</a>, <a href="prep03.html#p069">69</a>, etc.) It will be clear 
from these tables and from my "<a href="drill01.html">Drill Exercises</a>" that I by no 
means undervalue the importance of systematic training of the 
memory in the early stages of learning.</p>

<p>In the present edition (1908) I have marked the naturally long 
vowels in the text, as in the "<a href="prep00.html">Preparations</a>" and the <a href="vocab_a.html">alphabetical 
vocabulary</a>. But I have deliberately abstained from burdening 
the memory of pupils and teachers with subtleties of pronunciation, 
such as are involved in the marking of "hidden quantities" (except 
in such obvious cases as <i>rēx, lūx, nōndum</i>): e.g. <i>rēxi</i> from <i>rĕgo</i>, 
<i>tēxi</i> from <i>tĕgo</i>, <i>cōnstat</i> but <i>cŏndit</i>, <i>īnfert</i> but <i>ĭntulit</i>, <i>īnsanus</i> but 
<i>ĭncultus</i>. If a warning is needed against encumbering the teaching
of Latin with difficult questions of this kind, it will be found 
emphatically expressed in the recommendations of many of the 
<i>Lehrpläne</i> issued by German educational authorities.</p>

<p>Most of the passages will be found too long for one lesson, 
unless with older pupils. They must be split up, according to 
circumstances.</p>

<span id="pviii"/>
<p>It is possible that some teachers may prefer to use this book 
not as a first book in the strict sense of the term, but rather after 
say a year's work at some other book; and I can well imagine 
that it might be used to good purpose in this way, for instance as 
a bridge to Caesar, whose invasions of Britain are narrated in outline
in my <a href="story08.html">Chapters VIII.</a>&ndash;<a href="story14.html">XIV.</a>, or for practice in rapid reading 
side by side with an author.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to Lord Avebury for permission to 
reproduce the photographs of Roman and British coins which 
appear in this volume, especially of the coin of Antoninus Pius 
with the figure of Britannia upon it&mdash;the prototype of our modern 
penny.</p>

<p>The following passages have struck me since my Preface was 
written as throwing light on the idea of this book.</p>

<p><i>"The real question is not whether we shall go on teaching Latin, 
but what we can do to teach it so as to make learners understand that 
it is not a dead language at all."</i>&mdash;Sir F. P<small>OLLOCK</small>, in the 'Pilot,' 
Jan. 12th, 1901.</p>

<p><i>"We must convince our pupils of the reality of the study [Latin] 
by introducing them at as early a period as possible to a real book."</i>&mdash;P.
A. B<small>ARNETT</small> in "Common Sense in Education and Teaching," p. 210.</p>

<p><i>"Assimilate the system of teaching the classical languages to that 
which I have shadowed forth for modern language teaching."</i>&mdash;Professor
M<small>AHAFFY</small>, Address to Modem Language Association, 
Dec, 1901.</p>
