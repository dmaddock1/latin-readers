<p><i>A.</i> There had been peace between the Romans and the Britons 
after the first expedition of Caesar. It was not necessary for 
Caesar (<a href="prep07.html#psect024">§24</a>) to wage-war a-second-time against the free tribes of 
<span id="p129"/>
Britain. But he was desirous of glory and booty. Accordingly 
in the year 54 B.C. he transported five legions of Roman soldiers 
and a great multitude of Gallic horse-soldiers to our island. The 
soldiers of the Roman legions were foot-soldiers.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fna01">1</a></sup> Caesar did not 
feai the tempests<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fna02">2</a></sup> of the English channel; he did not fear the 
arrows and chariots of the British tribes. From (<i>ex</i>) the pluck 
of his soldiers and sailors he expected (<a href="prep07.html#psect026">§26</a>) victory.</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn01"><sup><a href="#fna01">1</a></sup> The word for 'foot-soldier' is <i>pedes</i> (stem <i>pedit-</i>), declined like <i>miles</i> and 
<i>eques</i>. [<i>ped-it-</i> means properly 'foot-goer,' as <i>equ-it-</i> means 'horse-goer.']</p>

<p class="fn" id="fn02"><sup><a href="#fna02">2</a></sup> Use <i>tempestas</i>, which also means 'weather' (<i>Preparations</i> <a href="prep09.html#psect029">§29</a>).</p>
