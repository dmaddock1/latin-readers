<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p>The Text has been carefully revised, the Notes have 
been thrown into a form which, it is hoped, will be 
found more convenient, and a little more help has been 
given in the Vocabulary.</p>

<p>My thanks for much valuable assistance are especially 
due to the Rev. E. C. Wickham, Head Master of Wellington
College, and to the Rev. E. D. Stone.</p>

<p>From a letter addressed to me by Mr. Wickham with 
reference to this book, I venture to quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It launches the student at once in ancient life. The old 
classical stories, simply told, seem to me much the best material for 
early Latin reading. They are abundantly interesting; they are 
taken for granted in the real literature of the language; and they 
can be told without starting the beginner on a wrong track by a 
barbarous mixture of ancient and modern ideas.</p>

<p>"It combines, if I may say so, very skilfully, the interest of a 
continuous story, with the gradual and progressive introduction of 
constructions and idioms. These seem to me to be introduced at the 
right moment, and to be played upon long enough to make them 
thoroughly familiar."</p>
</blockquote>
