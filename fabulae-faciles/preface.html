<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The difficulties encountered by beginners in Latin Translation
may be grouped as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>First.</i> Difficulties of Accidence; <i>i.e.</i> of ascertaining the 
meaning of each word by the help of the Vocabulary.</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Secondly.</i> Difficulties of Syntax; <i>i.e.</i> of determining 
the mutual relations of the words, and the order 
in which the words are to be taken.</p>

<p class="outdent"><i>Thirdly.</i> Difficulties of Idiom; <i>i.e.</i> of translating a 
group of words whose English equivalent is not 
the mere sum of the meanings of each separate 
word.</p>

<p>In even the easiest Latin author these difficulties 
are of course presented all at once: the inevitable result 
being a certain amount of confusion in the mind of the 
pupil.</p>

<p>In this book an attempt has been made to graduate 
difficulties without forcing any elaborate system upon 
<span id="piv"/>
the teacher. To separate Accidence from Syntax is of 
course impossible, but it is obviously desirable to defer 
the introduction of Idioms till the preliminary difficulties 
have been fairly mastered. Accordingly, <a href="01.html">Part I.</a> consists 
of detached sentences intended to afford practice in the 
Accidence, the use of the Vocabulary, and the simpler 
rules of Syntax. <a href="02_perseus.html">Part II.</a> consists of connected narrative, 
introducing by degrees all ordinary constructions, except 
those which come under the head of Idiom, as defined 
above. In <a href="03.html">Part III.</a> the Accusative and Infinitive and 
the Ablative Absolute are introduced.</p>

<p>The Relative, the Subjunctive, the Accusative and 
Infinitive, etc., are explained in special Notes, and Preliminary
Exercises on each are provided. These Notes 
and Exercises are placed separately at the end of the 
book, in order not to interfere with any method of explanation
that the teacher may prefer to adopt.</p>

<p>With a view to smoothing the way towards reading 
Caesar's Commentaries (which maintains, and is likely 
to maintain, its high place among text-books for lower 
forms), words and phrases employed by Caesar have been 
freely introduced throughout the book.</p>
