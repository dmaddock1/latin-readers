title: Easy Latin Readers
---
A bunch of great, easy to read Latin is now available online thanks to Google Books and other efforts to scan public domain books. Unfortunately, the OCR results from these page scans require a lot of proofreading to be suitable for learners to actually use.

This is a repository for digitized versions of easy Latin readers that have been proofread and cleaned.

* [Fabulae Faciles, by F. Richie](./fabulae-faciles/)
* [Ora Maritima, by E. A. Sonnenschein](./ora-maritima/)

## TODO

* Existing html markup is optimized for creating epub ebooks for personal use. This should be refactored into something more flexible.
* Richie's glossary is only digitized up to J.
